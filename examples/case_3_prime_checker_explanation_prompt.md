### Prime Checker - Beginner's Guide

#### What is a Prime Number?
A **prime number** is a whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself.

**Examples:**
- 2 is prime (only divisible by 1 and 2)
- 3 is prime (only divisible by 1 and 3)  
- 4 is NOT prime (divisible by 1, 2, and 4)
- 5 is prime (only divisible by 1 and 5)

#### Code Explanation

##### Function 1: `is_prime(n)` - Check if ONE number is prime

```
def is_prime(n):
    # First, we check if the input is valid
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError(f"Expected integer, got {type(n).__name__}")
    
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot check primality of negative numbers")
```

**What this does:**
- `isinstance(n, int)` checks if `n` is a whole number (integer)
- If not, it "raises an error" (stops the program and shows an error message)
- We can't have negative prime numbers, so we check for that too

```
    # Handle special cases
    if n < 2:
        return False  # Numbers less than 2 are not prime
    if n == 2:
        return True   # 2 is the only even prime number
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False  # All other even numbers are not prime
```

**What this does:**
- Numbers 0 and 1 are not considered prime
- 2 is special - it's the only even prime number
- `n % 2 == 0` means "n divided by 2 has no remainder" (n is even)
- If a number is even (except 2), it's not prime

```
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False  # Found a divisor, so not prime
        i += 2  # Only check odd numbers
    
    return True  # No divisors found, so it's prime
```

**What this does:**
- We only need to check up to the square root of n (mathematical trick!)
- We start with 3 and check every odd number (3, 5, 7, 9, 11...)
- `n % i == 0` means "n is divisible by i"
- If we find ANY divisor, the number is not prime
- If we check all possibilities and find no divisors, it's prime!

**Why only check up to square root?**
If a number has a divisor larger than its square root, it must also have a corresponding smaller divisor. So we only need to check the smaller ones!

##### Function 2: `get_primes(limit)` - Find ALL primes up to a number

```
def get_primes(limit):
    # Input validation (same as before)
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        raise TypeError(f"Expected integer, got {type(limit).__name__}")
    
    if limit < 0:
        raise ValueError("Limit cannot be negative")
    
    if limit < 2:
        return []  # No primes less than 2
```

**What this does:**
- Same error checking as before
- If limit is less than 2, return an empty list (no primes to find)

```
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes - a clever algorithm!
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)  # Create a list of True values
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False   # 0 and 1 are not prime
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a list where each position represents a number
- `[True] * (limit + 1)` creates a list like `[True, True, True, True...]`
- We start by assuming all numbers might be prime
- Then we mark 0 and 1 as False (not prime)

```
    for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:  # If i is still marked as prime
            for j in range(i * i, limit + 1, i):
                sieve[j] = False  # Mark all multiples as not prime
```

**What this does:**
- For each number i from 2 to √limit
- If i is still marked as prime
- Mark all multiples of i as not prime (i×i, i×(i+1), i×(i+2), etc.)
- This is called "sieving" - we're filtering out non-primes

**Example with limit = 10:**
- Start: `[False, False, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]`
- After sieving with 2: `[False, False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False]`
- After sieving with 3: `[False, False, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False]`
- Final primes: 2, 3, 5, 7

```
    return [i for i in range(2, limit + 1) if sieve[i]]
```

**What this does:**
- Goes through the sieve and collects all numbers still marked as True
- Returns them as a list of prime numbers

##### Function 3: `prime_factorization(n)` - Break a number into prime factors

```
def prime_factorization(n):
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError(f"Expected integer, got {type(n).__name__}")
    
    if n < 2:
        raise ValueError("Cannot factorize numbers less than 2")
    
    factors = []  # List to store the prime factors
    d = 2         # Start checking from 2
```

**What this does:**
- Same error checking
- Creates an empty list to store the prime factors
- Starts checking divisors from 2

```
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:  # While d divides n evenly
            factors.append(d)  # Add d to our factors list
            n //= d            # Divide n by d
        d += 1  # Try the next potential divisor
```

**What this does:**
- Keep dividing n by d as long as d divides evenly
- Each time we divide, we add d to our factors list
- `n //= d` means "n = n divided by d" (integer division)
- Move to the next potential divisor

**Example with n = 12:**
- d = 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6, add 2 to factors, n becomes 6
- d = 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3, add 2 to factors, n becomes 3
- d = 2: 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 (not even), move to d = 3
- d = 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1, add 3 to factors, n becomes 1
- Final factors: [2, 2, 3]

```
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)  # If there's a remainder, it's also a prime factor
    
    return factors
```

**What this does:**
- If n is still greater than 1 after all divisions, it's a prime factor itself
- Add it to our factors list and return the complete list

## Key Programming Concepts Used

##### 1. **Error Handling**
```
if not isinstance(n, int):
    raise TypeError("Expected integer")
```
- Checks if input is the right type
- "Raises" an error if something is wrong
- Prevents the program from crashing mysteriously

##### 2. **Boolean Logic**
```
if n % 2 == 0:
    return False
```
- Uses True/False values
- `%` is the "modulo" operator (gives remainder after division)
- `==` checks if two things are equal

##### 3. **Loops**
```
while i * i <= n:
    # do something
    i += 2
```
- Repeats code while a condition is true
- `i += 2` means "add 2 to i"

##### 4. **Lists**
```
factors = []
factors.append(d)
```
- `[]` creates an empty list
- `.append()` adds items to the end of the list

##### 5. **List Comprehensions**
```
[i for i in range(2, limit + 1) if sieve[i]]
```
- A compact way to create lists
- Reads like: "give me i for each i in this range, but only if sieve[i] is True"

#### Why These Algorithms Are Clever

1. **Square Root Optimization**: We only check divisors up to √n because any larger divisor would have a corresponding smaller one.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Instead of checking each number individually, we eliminate all multiples at once. Much faster for finding many primes!

3. **Skip Even Numbers**: After checking 2, we only check odd numbers since all other even numbers are composite.

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting edge cases**: Always handle 0, 1, 2, and negative numbers specially
2. **Not validating input**: Always check that your input is what you expect
3. **Inefficient algorithms**: Don't check every number from 2 to n-1 for large numbers
4. **Off-by-one errors**: Be careful with ranges (should it be `<=` or `<`?)

This code demonstrates good programming practices: it's efficient, handles errors gracefully, and includes helpful comments and tests!
