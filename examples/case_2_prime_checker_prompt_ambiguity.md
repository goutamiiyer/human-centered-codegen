## What the Model Did Well

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Renamed Functions | Clearer function names like `is_prime`, `get_factors` enhance readability |
| Educational Printouts | Walkthrough examples with outputs are helpful for beginners |
| Removed Extra Layers | Focuses only on necessary steps without multiple algorithmic layers |
| Simple & Linear Logic | Uses straightforward `for` loops and avoids advanced optimizations |
| Grouped Tests | All demonstrations are together and logical (primes, ranges, factors, examples) |
| Annotated Logic | Helpful inline comments explaining `%`, loops, and conditionals |

---

## What Could Be Improved

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Missed Optimization | Does not apply `sqrt(n)` trick in `is_prime`, which would improve performance |
| No Error Handling | Lacks input validation for non-integer or negative inputs |
| No Use of Helper Utilities | Could reuse `get_factors` inside `is_prime` or vice versa |
| Duplicate Print Logic | Repeats very similar logic in both `is_prime` and the detailed walkthroughs |
| Assumes Clean Inputs | Doesn't handle edge cases like non-numeric types, floats, etc. |
| Slight Overlap | Manual walkthroughs for 7 and 9 echo logic already handled by `is_prime()` |

## Verdict

**Score (1–5)**

| Criterion                   | Score |
|----------------------------|-------|
| Logic Simplification       | 4.5   |
| Readability                | 5     |
| Correctness                | 5     |
| Optimization Awareness     | 2.5   |
| Educational Clarity        | 4.5   |
| Input Robustness           | 2     |

**Overall Score:** 4.1 / 5  
**Summary:** Great for educational purposes and readability. Could use some optimization improvements and basic input validation. Delivers well on the “simplify the logic” prompt while keeping the structure clear for beginners.
