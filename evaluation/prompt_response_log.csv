P001,"write a prime checker",baseline,"Single function using O(sqrt(n)) logic, no extras",Claude,"Gave three versions: simple O(n), optimized O(√n), advanced (6k±1) with testing and sieve",Yes,3,Yes,No,Code Generation,"Model overgenerated; went beyond base request with extras like range checkers and performance tests"
P002,"add error handling",error_handling,"Same function with basic type and value checks (TypeError, ValueError)",Claude,"Added type checks, exceptions, range guards, plus input validation and exception-safe wrappers",Yes,4,Yes,No,Correctness,"Model added full validation, test harness, and raised proper errors across functions"
P003,"explain this code to a beginner",explanation,"Plain-English walkthrough of each line or section with examples",Claude,"Explained each function clearly using simple language, examples, and analogies",Yes,5,No,No,Explainability,"Highly human-centered and beginner-friendly; could include visuals or diagrams"
P004,"simplify the logic",simplify_logic,"Flattened control flow, fewer checks, minimalist logic for is_prime",Claude,"Simplified to a single basic version of is_prime; added supporting functions with clear names",Yes,4.5,No,No,Simplicity,"Good clarity; lacks optimization like √n, no input checks or edge case guards"
